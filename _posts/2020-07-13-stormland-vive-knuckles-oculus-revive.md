Are you a Vive owner who's tired of playing the same titles month after month? 
Are you looking for quality VR experiences but don't know where to find them? 
The Oculus store has a ton of great games that can be played on your Vive.

#### You need Revive!
[Revive](https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive) integrates Oculus software with OpenXR to run Oculus games on your Vive.

Additionally, in case there are any issues with your Vive Wands, Valve Index Controllers make for great replacements.

#### My System:  
* [Intel 8700 I7](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/126686/intel-core-i7-8700-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-60-ghz.html)
* 32 GB RAM 
* [Nvidia Geforce 1080ti](https://www.nvidia.com/en-sg/geforce/products/10series/geforce-gtx-1080-ti/)
* [SteamVR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/)
* [Valve Index Controllers](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/index/controllers)
* HTC Vive Headset 
* [BaseStation ver 1.0](https://www.vive.com/eu/accessory/base-station/)

#### Installation: 
1. Install Oculus and Revive by following the steps in the Installation section of their [github](https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive). 
2. Purchase and install [Stormland](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1360938750683878/?ranking_trace=117254459210015_1360938750683878_SKYLINEWEB_15sLveFiOUbKwuHmu) from the [Oculus Store](https://www.oculus.com/).

There is a bug with the Oculus software that results in the inability to install any software purchased from [Oculus](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/). If you experience this bug you must set a new location for your Oculus saved games. After doing this the games will install and run normally. 

Ensure that the location you are saving your downloaded Oculus games to is not _C:\Program Files\Oculus_. 

To set a new location for your saved games, follow the steps in this [link](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-where-you-save-oculus-rift-games-your-pc).

Create a new folder for the game location or just put it in Documents or wherever you want other than _C:\Program Files\Oculus_.

#### Configure:
Control Bindings (Steam Workshop)
Controller Type (SteamVR)
Disable thumb-pad press binding

Restart your progress (optional):
In case you want to restart the game or have another person start their own progress, there really isn't a proper way to do it in the game.  To get around this, you can delete and recreate your save files locally, and then sync them to the cloud to restart the game.
